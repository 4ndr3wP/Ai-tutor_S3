School of IT Capstone 11.1P: Learning Summary Report Overview of the
Task The learning summary report forms the start of your portfolio and
is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your achievements and learning
to the assessment panel.

Steps Download the task resources from OnTrack, extract the template for
your reflection and a copy of the assessment rubric.

Complete the report template, save it to PDF, and upload it to OnTrack.

Remember to focus on demonstrating how you have used the capstone
program to showcase your capabilities. Use the personas described in the
assessment rubric when providing a self- assessment, as your ability to
accurately self-assess will influence your result.

Note: submitting this task is NOT the final step in this unit -- you
still need to create your Portfolio on OnTrack afterwards.
