Mentor Update (Week 4)

• I've continued my work on our team's Research Report, focusing on
developing a meaningful, statistically backed narrative for the "AI and
the Transformation of the Education Industry" section. • I've maintained
regular contact with my teammates via our MS Teams group chat to ensure
alignment and progress. • I've continued my active participation in both
the AI Generalist and Product Owner (PO) meetings, contributing vocally
to discussions on MS Teams. • In anticipation of our final video
presentation, I've begun experimenting with various text-to-voice AI
models to find a suitable one. • I've also started experimenting with
open-source text-to-video models to generate relevant visuals for the
presentation. • I've shared the most promising outputs from my
text-to-voice and text-to-video experiments with my teammates on our
Teams channel to gather their feedback.

General Comments & Career Plan

I'm enjoying the practical application of the unit, particularly the
opportunity to upskill by experimenting with new generative AI models
for our presentation. My career plan is to secure a graduate role within
a government agency for next year. A recurring challenge in interviews
has been a negative perception of AI's role, which contrasts with my
specialisation. My next step is to better articulate how my skills in AI
can be a significant asset to the public sector, framing it as a
positive and necessary evolution rather than a threat.
