Responsible Team Member Contract Plan This trimester, I plan to
contribute to my project team and company, InnovAlte, by being an active
team member for the Education and Education Technology stream of the AI
Generalist Project. This will require my active and ongoing
participation in team meetings, project meetings, and Product Owner
meetings on MS Teams, as well as my continued engagement in MS Teams
messages. By doing this I will prove myself a reliable and dependable
team mate who is open to communication, whether it be to share their own
knowledge or to listen to others when needed.

My primary technical goal is to continue the development of a chatbot
application by implementing advanced features such as a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and improved dialogue
flow. This project is designed as a local, offline-first application to
ensure user privacy and data security, with the ultimate goal of
creating a genuinely useful tool for students facing a real need to be
able to have LLM responses refer to their (the student's) existing study
materials.

In parallel, I will research and evaluate local open-source AI models to
identify practical use cases that can help students and teaching staff.
This involves not only technical experimentation but also critically
assessing the models to provide specialist advice on their best
applications within an educational context.

As a team member, throughout, I will foster a positive and collaborative
team environment by facilitating clear communication, supporting my
teammates, and ensuring all contributions are valued. I will also
produce clear technical and user-facing documentation, including video
demonstrations, to communicate my work effectively to both technical and
non-technical audiences. Through these combined technical and teamwork
efforts, I aim to make an ongoing contribution to our shared project
goals.

Contract I understand that to be a responsible team member I need to:

• Make lasting technical contributions to the company through the
application of my discipline knowledge and IT skills. • Clearly and
concisely highlight, describe, and provide evidence of my individual
contributions to the company, projects/products, and cohorts. •
Regularly engage with my team(s) to collaborate on project deliverables
associated with my role, and to support others in my team(s). • Attend
and participate in team meetings. • Make sure that my efforts and
progress, and the efforts and progress of my team(s), are accurately
reported to those in leadership positions so that they can recognise
successes and mitigate failures in a timely way. • Behaviour in a way
that is respectful of others. Name: Andrew Paull
