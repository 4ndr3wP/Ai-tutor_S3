Pass Task 10.1: MultiObjective Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

During Week 10, you have learnt about Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning. With this context, answer the following:

- 1. What is multiobjective reinforcement learning and how is it fundamentally different from single-objective reinforcement learning?
- 2. Refer to https://mo-gymnasium.farama.org/environments/grid-world/ and pick any environment. Describe the environment in detail. What is the multiobjective problem in the context of this environment?
- 3. The manufacturer of the futuristic Al-powered cleaning robot from Task 2 insists that the robot be upgraded with Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) capabilities to ensure safety and sustainability. Is this upgrade justified? Provide examples of how MORL could make the robot safer and more sustainable.

## Constraints

Please keep your answers short and to the point.
