## SIT796 Reinforcement Learning

## High Distinction Task 8.2: Deep RL

## Overview

- 1. Implement double DON on the CartPole environment from the week 8 workshop. Compare its learning curve with that of DON. Ensure the learning curves are computed over at least 5 seeds, showing the number of learning steps (not episodes) on the horizontal axis. The standard error or standard deviations should be shown using shaded regions, similar to Fig 3 of the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461 What do your plots reveal? Why?
- 2. Come up with 3 approaches (along with your justifications) which could help improve DON's speed of learning (meaning the modified approach should be able to collect more rewards with the same number of environment interactions/steps). Implement one of these approaches and plot its performance along with the plots in part 1. Did your modification work? Why/why not?
- 3. Implement your chosen modified DON approach from part 2. on any other standard environment. Compare its performance with that of DON. Is it still doing better than DON? Why/why not?

Although not mandatory, for this task, you may choose to use your $100 worth of google colab credits. Try as much as possible to not exhaust all your $100 for this task.

## Constraints

Please keep your answers short and to the point. This task will only be assessed once. After that, you may make corrections to it at the time of portfolio submission.
